# Zedu APP

Zedu is a cross-platform collaboration system that consolidates messaging, channels, calls, file sharing, search, and AI coworkers into a unified workspace. It is designed to eliminate fragmentation across tools, reduce context switching, and enable teams to collaborate in real time with intelligent assistance and consistent performance across Web, Mobile, and Desktop.

## Overview

Modern teams depend on multiple disconnected tools: chat apps, conferencing tools, wikis, file sharing apps, and standalone AI assistants. This creates inefficiency and loss of context. Zedu provides a single, structured environment where users, teams, and AI colleagues can work together seamlessly.

The platform supports:

- Unified messaging across channels, direct messages, and AI coworker interactions

- Real-time collaboration through voice and video calls

- File, media, and link organization

- Cross-device continuity

- AI automation and agent workflows

- Intelligent search and workspace discovery

This repository contains the frontend implementation for the Zedu application.

## Getting Started

To run this app locally, you should have the following programs installed on your computer:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)>=20.0.0
- [pnpm](https://yarnpkg.com/)>=9.4.0

git clone git@github.com/hngprojects/Zedu_fe.git
cd Zedu_fe
```

## Mobile website navigation

On narrow screens, use the named navigation button to open or close the menu.
Keyboard users can reach it with Tab and activate it with Enter or Space. The
button exposes the menu's expanded state and has a visible focus indicator.
Press Escape while the menu is open to close it and return focus to the button.
Closed menu links are removed from the page and cannot receive keyboard focus.

To verify, run `pnpm dev`, open the homepage at a mobile viewport width, and
check Tab, Enter, Space, Escape, and the navigation links. Touch and mouse
activation use the same button.
