# Config from the base checkout: .github/preview.env, .github/preview-orgs.
#
# The build artifact's meta.json is written next to PR code, so nothing here trusts it: the PR,
# gate and backend are recomputed from the GitHub API and the base branch config.
# State: one bot comment per PR, edited in place:
#   <!-- fe-preview state=active|queued|expired|evicted|removed|error|skipped sha= tag= host= dep= at= -->
# `at` is the expiry baseline: when this commit last became active or queued (a push, or a
# revival by the `preview` label). Rewrites while it stays active or queued (settle, sweep,
# body-edit redeploys) keep it, so TTL and eviction don't drift.
# A preview only leaves `active` once Coolify confirms the delete, so a failed delete is retried.
